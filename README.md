# Text Adventure

This has been an awesome expiriment, and a fun way to learn more GoLang! I'm really starting to appreciate the way that the strictness and typesafe-ness of Go lends itself to making more organized code, and catching errors earlier on. Also, this project has helped me to realize that I've progressed quite a bit --I now was able to figure out the organization of the text adventure logic by myself (and in an entirely new language!) :). I've definetly learned a lot from this.

To run the go project, make sure to run `go run .` to access all the files at once.
